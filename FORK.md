# MA Economics fork

This fork adds two courses and one destination on top of upstream Mathua. It
adds no new concepts or generators: everything uses the existing graph.

| ID | Course | Targets | Concepts incl. prerequisites |
|---|---|---|---|
| `econ5153` | Math for Economists (ECON 5153) | 42 | 143 |
| `statlearn` | Statistical Learning (ISLR companion) | 25 | 129 |

Destination `ma-econ` chains both courses. Neither course pulls in any
trigonometry. The only geometry prerequisite is plotting a point.

The placement diagnostic credits prerequisites when you answer harder
questions correctly, so arithmetic and algebra basics are skipped unless you
miss something.

## Run it

Requires Go 1.26+ and Node 20+.

```bash
make local        # builds the UI against your own server, then serves http://localhost:8080
```

Sign up in the app, take the diagnostic, then pick the "MA Economics"
destination. Progress is stored in `mathua.db` in the repo root.

Use `make local`, not `npm run build` alone. The default UI build
(`web/next-app/.env.production`) talks to the upstream hosted API, which does not
have these courses.

## What these courses cover

**econ5153:** derivatives and basic integration (substitution, FTC) incl. exp/log and implicit differentiation, convexity
and Jensen, marginal analysis, single-variable optimization, partial
derivatives, gradient, directional derivatives, multivariable chain rule,
Jacobian, tangent plane, second-order Taylor, the two-variable second-derivative
test, extrema on closed regions, Lagrange multipliers (one and two constraints),
implicit function theorem, Euler's homogeneous function theorem; matrix
inverses, determinants, Cramer's rule, rank and rank-nullity, eigenvalues,
diagonalization, definiteness of quadratic forms; linear recurrences,
first-order linear and second-order homogeneous ODEs, linear systems, phase
portraits, equilibria and stability.

**statlearn:** expectation, variance, covariance, correlation, conditional
expectation, CLT, Bayes' theorem; sampling distributions, standard errors,
confidence intervals, t statistics, p-values, Type I/II errors; least-squares
line, projection onto a subspace, R², prediction, gradient descent;
overfitting, cross-validation, ridge penalty, logistic regression, feature
scaling, one-hot encoding; k-means, Gini impurity, bagging and random forests,
PCA variance explained; confusion matrix, precision/recall/F1, ROC, class
imbalance.

One quirk: upstream's graph routes logistic regression and KNN through a few
neural-net basics (perceptron, forward pass, sigmoid activation, cross-entropy
loss), so `statlearn` includes those four as prerequisites.

## Not covered (use ISLR / course notes)

- Multiple regression in matrix form (β̂ = (X'X)⁻¹X'y) and coefficient inference
- Lasso, bootstrap, bias–variance decomposition, LDA/QDA, SVMs
- Econ framing of dynamics: cobweb models, saddle paths, discrete-time stability
- Causal inference (DAGs, d-separation, adjustment sets)

## Editing the courses

Courses live in `data/courses.json` as a list of target concept IDs, and are read
at startup. Restart the server after editing. Concept IDs are in
`data/concepts/*.json`. Run `go run scripts/validate_graph.go` after any change.
